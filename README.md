# 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
    Purpose: Provides the structure of the page.
    In your output, HTML defines elements like:
       The clock area (<div id="time">)
       The date area (<div id="date">)
       The calendar grid (<div id="calendar">)
       The buttons (<button>Prev</button>, Next, Toggle Theme)
    Think of HTML as the skeleton of the application.

# 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
    Purpose: Controls the design, colors, layout, and animations.
    In your output, CSS is responsible for:
      The dark theme background (dark blue/black look).
      The orange highlight on the 11th day.
      The grid layout of the calendar (7 columns for days of the week).
      The button styling (orange buttons with rounded corners).
    CSS makes the app look polished and professional — it’s the skin and clothes of the skeleton.

# 3. JavaScript (JS)
     Purpose: Adds interactivity and logic.
     In your output, JavaScript does the following:
         Updates the clock every second (setInterval(updateTime, 1000)).
         Displays the current date in words (e.g., “Wednesday, 11 February 2026”).
         Generates the calendar dynamically for the current month.
         Highlights today’s date in orange.
         Handles the Prev/Next buttons to move between months.
         Handles the Toggle Theme button to switch between dark and light mode.
      JavaScript is the brain that makes the skeleton move.

# 🔄 How It Works Together
    1.HTML builds the structure (clock, date, calendar, buttons).
    2.CSS styles everything (dark theme, colors, layout).
    3.JavaScript updates the time, generates the calendar, and responds when you click buttons.
    So, when you open this file in a browser:
    The HTML loads first.
    The CSS applies the design.
    The JavaScript runs continuously, updating the clock and handling user actions.
